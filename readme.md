# Brain Tumor Classification

This project aims to classify whether a patient has a brain tumor based on various features or parameters. The strongest parameters influencing the presence of a tumor will also be identified.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project should contain relevant features or parameters that can be used to predict the presence of a brain tumor. Examples of such features could include age, gender, genetic factors, medical history, symptoms, and various medical test results (e.g., MRI scans, CT scans, blood tests).

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features if necessary.

2. **Feature Selection**: Identify the most relevant features that contribute significantly to the prediction task. This can be done using techniques such as correlation analysis, recursive feature elimination, or feature importance scores from machine learning models.

3. **Model Selection and Training**: Choose an appropriate machine learning model (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, neural networks) and train it on the preprocessed dataset. Techniques such as cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning can be employed to optimize model performance.

4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model's performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.

5. **Feature Importance Analysis**: Analyze the trained model to identify the strongest parameters or features that contribute most to the prediction of brain tumor presence. This can be done using techniques such as feature importance scores, partial dependence plots, or SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values.

## Output

The output of this project will be:

1. A trained machine learning model capable of classifying whether a patient has a brain tumor based on the provided features or parameters.

2. A report or visualization highlighting the strongest parameters or features influencing the presence of a brain tumor, based on the feature importance analysis.
